# PodcastApp_Desktop
Desktop version of my thesis work; to illustrate cross platform synchronization of audio podcasts!

Below are links to runnable versions of the application, with included runtimes of the JVM for the native installers.  
OBS! Synchronization with Dropbox are disabled in these versions, since it only works with the author's account as of right now!

OBS! For the jar to run properly, you need to have atleast JDK 8 installed, and make sure JavaFX is included if you're running under Linux!
